867. Transpose Matrix

Given a 2D integer array matrix, return the transpose of matrix.

The transpose of a matrix is the matrix flipped over its main diagonal, switching the matrix's row and column indices.



 

Example 1:

Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[1,4,7],[2,5,8],[3,6,9]]
Example 2:

Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
Output: [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]
